### This repository was created to solve an issue that I will be show below. It's not a _component_ or _library_ for React Native

#### Problem
I need to make a dynamic Picker. They are 02 Pickers and the second options appear according to the option selected in the first Picker.

In *iOS* everything works fine, as shown in the gif below. But in *Android* I got the error `Cannot read 'props' of null` when I select any Picker at second time.

All code is here: [/src/Picker/index.js](https://github.com/danielfeelfine/react-native-picker/blob/master/src/Picker/index.js)

Suggestions through issues, pull requests or [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42663604/how-to-make-a-dynamic-picker-using-react-native) in Stack Overflow are welcome.
